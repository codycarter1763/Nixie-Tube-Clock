# Nixie Tube Clock

# About
This is a build log on how I built a nixie tube clock from old IN-14 and IN-3 nixie tubes, Arduino, and real time clock. 

## What Are Nixie Tubes?
Nixie tubes are a type of electronic device used for numerical displaying of letters and numbers. They were a precursor to LED displays first introduced as a useable product in the 1950's by David Hagelbarger. Nixie tubes are made up of a wire mesh anode connected to a high voltage DC source, a glass tube filled with neon and argon, and metal cathodes connected to metal pieces in the shape of a character. When the anode is powered and a cathode is grounded, a warm glow is emmited around the character. 

Nixie tubes were really popular because of their aesthetic, high contrast for good readibility, and really long lifespan. Even though LED displays outshine nixie tubes with lower power consumption, less complex driver circuts, and less operating and manufacturing costs, their steampunk look and history behind them add a vintage charm and one of a kind look to any project.
